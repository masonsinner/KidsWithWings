				<h3>Who We Are</h3>
			</div>
				<p class="p1">Our owner and founder Dr. Ubel loved two things in life, his kids and causing chaaos. One day while he was down in his labratory, he heard a scream from upstairs. He rushed from the basebment only to see almost every belonging in rubble. He was so upset with his kids, as they broke his 1984 World Badminton Participation trophy. Filled with rage he sent them up to their rooms without dinner. Laughing devilishly back down to the labratory, a light bulb turned on. Now Dr. Ubel hated light, but as he went to go turn it off, the metaphorical light bulb turned on. His kids didn't reach anything by the ceiling. He rushed downstairs with this new idea, and begun work. After many sleepless and kidless nights, he had finally done it. He created Kids With Wings, a device that will cause chaos and happiness within kids. His device allowed the kids to fly around the house, leaving no fan untouched.</p>
